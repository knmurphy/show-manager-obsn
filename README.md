# show-manager-obsn

This project is building a show link generator for OBS.Ninja using [AWS Honeycode](https://honeycode.aws).  I am still pretty early in the process but wanted to share this Google Sheets version we built at Kindly Ops since you can copy it and get some use out of it now.

What features are coming?

- manage show/participant links for guests
- manage director room configurations
- import pre-made CSV of guests and settings

I am very interested in features/functions that the community would like to have so please feel free to request features in the Issues tab for this repository.

As far as the Honeycode workbook I haven't figured out the way I would like to share it for others to use/customize but I do plan on sharing as much as I can.
